    Dataclasses very obsure subject than the other ones 
    data classes are something ive grown in python . 
    A data class is a class whose sole purpose is to hold data 
    the class will have variables than can be acced and written to but there is no extra logic to it .

    So what does this do exactly ? 
    You define things with name and type 
    while the function of our class is limited, the point of the data class 
    is to increase efficiency and reduce errors in your code . 
    its much better to pass around a vector3d than a int variable , so having this is better .
