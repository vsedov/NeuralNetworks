So something that you will have to note about is when you are using theese values 
when ever you do have some sort of sumunation, the dx of that will always be one, for both x and y 
the reason for that is quite obvious but for teh sake of not understand, the main reason for that is because it is x ^ 1 -1 
meaning you will always get zero, though this is some what confusing for me in th elong term, but im sure i will get it soon 
what it is doing is, going back and looking back at those partial dx and see thse changes that those values have on the 
whole system, and the one that has the most impact would get chosen, thats from what i can tell though 

So something that you would ahve to realise is that you would always have that given sum to some sort of function
when ever you would have to do when ever you would have to deal with those sytem values 

What we do is the given formula that i have writen down within the given book that i have, but this does not stop 
the fact that there is so much more that would have to 
be covered when writing this . 

Onwe iof the thing that you have to do when continuing 
doing the backward parse is tht 
the function that comes before the sum
is the multiplication, of the weights and inputs 
the dx for a product is what ever , is always going to be 
one . 

So if you are multipling through the given values 
what you are doing 
is doing a partial dx of the weights and the input values 


In this case, Pd [x] of f(x,y) =y 
 Pd [y] of f(x,y) =x

 notice the given trend there 

 the partial dx value of what ever we havem wuth resepct
 to x, would equal y 
 and a partial dx with respect to y woudl equal x 

 Here is some further reason for how this owuld work, for
 ease of use and understanding . 

 Because i can get it, it can seem some what annoying if you 
 dont know whats going on
