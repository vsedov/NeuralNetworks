So something that you will have to note about is when you are using theese values 
when ever you do have some sort of sumunation, the dx of that will always be one, for both x and y 
the reason for that is quite obvious but for teh sake of not understand, the main reason for that is because it is x ^ 1 -1 
meaning you will always get zero, though this is some what confusing for me in th elong term, but im sure i will get it soon 
what it is doing is, going back and looking back at those partial dx and see thse changes that those values have on the 
whole system, and the one that has the most impact would get chosen, thats from what i can tell though
